This is the future home of the D2 language version of Bikeshed OS

The OS is currently at the first milestone, which includes having
running processes and working memory/system calls. Before the code
grows further it will go through a massive refactoring. Essentially
most parts of the OS will be completely rewritten and the directory
structure will change to facilitate multiple architectures better.
After the refactoring methods will be commented and each of the
modules will have a defined interface. Most notably the physical
and virtual memory modules will be completely rewritten as they're
pretty bad right now. Hopefully once this process is complete it
will be a half-decent OS and more fun things can start to happen.
